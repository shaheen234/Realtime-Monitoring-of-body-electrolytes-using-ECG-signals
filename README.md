This project aims to develop a portable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor system designed to non-invasively monitor ECG signals from the arm, enabling the real-time detection of electrolyte imbalances. By eliminating the need for intrusive methods, the purpose of this system is to enhance accessibility and comfort in health monitoring. This innovative approach seeks to make health management more user-friendly and encourage widespread adoption of regular health check-ups.
